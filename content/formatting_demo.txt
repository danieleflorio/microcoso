This post demonstrates the new formatting features in microcoso.

## Text Formatting

You can use **bold text** for emphasis and *italic text* for styling. You can even combine them for ***bold and italic*** text.

## Headings

### This is a third-level heading

#### This is a fourth-level heading

Headings automatically create structure for your posts.

## Unordered Lists

- First item in the list
- Second item with some details
- Third item to complete the set

## Ordered Lists

1. First step in the process
2. Second step to follow
3. Third step to complete

## Inline Code

Use the `console.log()` function to debug your JavaScript code. You can also reference variables like `myVariable` in your text.

## Code Blocks

Here's a complete code example:

```
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

## Mixed Content

This paragraph contains **bold text**, *italic text*, and `inline code` all together. You can also include [link: links to external sites | https://www.github.com ].

For images, use the image syntax:
